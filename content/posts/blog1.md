<p>For the last couple of months we have gotten back to circuit boards and looking at completing the project we started a long time ago. Making the shower smart and easily controllable like one would expect from modern consumer products. There's been a lot to learn considering all we could do a few years ago was wire up a light bulb, and even then we would need to check what the difference was with the brown wire (live/positive) and the blue wire (ground/neutral).</p>
<p>To keep it simple last year we started working on a fully analog version of the system, just like the one below.</p>

<p>Basically it's a switch panel and buttons where the top 3 water proof/resistant rocker switches are  to activate the pump, uv and heater and a 6 toggle switch switch-board below to control the individual valves. The top 3 buttons go to the power box that activated the relays with a 1 V DC current to close the circuit for the 220V AC to power the aforementioned devices. The valves are controlled directly via the 12V DC power supply.</p>

<p>Anyway, that was the old one. Since then we've added all kindsa stuff. An integrated GFCI, fuses, an 8-channel relay module, voltage meter for the pump and a motor controller, Power button and the appropriate cable glands to keep everything up to spec. The cables should be around 18 AWG or lower (thicker).</p>
<p>Additionally to make it easier to use in everyday use we made an analog controller. This should be done with an integrated circuit but I don't have experience with that and the last two people I've tried to work with have failed to help me so I'm starting from the most basic setup that I can understand and make myself. So below you can see the schematic connecting one switch to multiple devices using diodes to keep the flow in one direction.</p>
