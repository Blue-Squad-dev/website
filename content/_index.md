                    Standard Development vs Accessible & Responsive Development
                </h2>
                <p class="intro-description">
                WCAG is short for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, and is the current industry standard for web content accessibility in the United States. 
                In order to meet the needs of all clients, our team of dedicated and experienced developers ensure that the final product is accessible to all visitors including those with disabilities.
                While standard development may be more inexpensive in comparison, WCAG compliance is <strong>integral</strong> in building a website that emphasizes accesibility for
                users with disabilities. Compliance with WCAG guidelines is necessary in order to <strong>avoid potential lawsuits and/or government action</strong> when building your business.
                With accessible development in mind, your website gains advantages by remaining inclusive to all visitors:
