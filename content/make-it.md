        It’s not ready, but I’m already 227 days overdue. Tragic. I’m really sorry to everyone that I said I’d have it done on the weekend. The inspiration just never came. I didn’t want to dissapoint you, I just dissapointed myself. Anyway. Today is my birthday (16.5.2019) and I turn 33. OMG where is the time going. I think the first Idea for the Showerloop was in the 90’s but I’d say it started in 2012 when we started scavanging parts to start building it. I’ve come a long way and not that far at the same time. Here’s to the next 227 days.
