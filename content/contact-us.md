        <p>Incase you want to support the project we have an effective <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/making-the-world-greener">gofundme</a> campaign.</p>
        <p> Basically we have little raw materials so we recycle a lot of materials, we also have the space and access to tools (yay, Fablab!) that allow us to continue our work.</p>
        <p>We are also starting to collaborate with people around the world to bring Showerloop to where they need it, be it a boat, an RV, a house in the woods, a far off Pacific Island, a brand new hay-bale house or a really old building without plumbing. The possibilities are endless and together hope to create them all.</p>
        <p>We're currently looking for a suitable business model that would encourage a community around social and environmental ethics and the open source circular economy.</p>
