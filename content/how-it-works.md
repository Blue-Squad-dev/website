                    We start with focusing on the main goal for your site and outline the different ideas formed to meet
                    your needs.

                    If you already have a site, our team will deeply explore every component and present you with a detailed
                    outline indicating accessibility issues and any others we find.

                    We work with you to outline specific design preferences and branding to ensure the final product
                    is exactly what you need.

                    is perfect.

                Our team of dedicated developers all have a passion for technology and art. We aim to <strong>always</strong> find the best route for a website to take in order to meet it's full potential. 
                The internet is built for everyone, not just those who can easily access it. Because of this, our designs aim to be <strong>intuitive and minimalist</strong> while maintaining the utmost accessibility
                so that every vistor has a seamless experience including those who might not be able to have that with other sites.

                Here's a little preview of how we imagine a complete household water loop to look like. By reusing the
                same water from one process to another we can dramatically decrease water consumption without having to
                sacrifice. We are building the system piece by piece but we need parts. If you make things like plumbing
                components, valves, pumps, ultra violet systems and filters let's work together. If you have spare parts
                feel free to send them to us :)

    <h2>How It Will Work</h2>
    Get in the shower and select your desired water temperature on a small screen. Once you press start, water begins to
    flow just like in a normal shower, the difference is that instead of the water being wasted by letting it go down
    the drain, it's collected and pumped though several filters:

    <h2>
        Automate, Monitor, Re-program, Customise
    </h2>
    <p>
        Multiple sensors and a micro-controller are used to allow for complete monitoring and control of the system so
        you can understand more about your own behavior and personalize the shower to fit your needs (e.g. tell you when
        to get out of the shower in case youâ€™re in a hurry). You can set your ideal showering conditions like flow rate,
        water temperature, ambiance and to automatically wash the filters once you've left the shower so that the
        filters last longer before requiring manual maintenance. By measuring use and changes in flow rate it can inform
        you when to change filters.

        Currently we are using a simple two-row, two-color LCD screen (below) but in the future the interface could look
        more like this and be programmed by your smart phone (it's just a draft so don't get caught up on the numbers -
        it's only an example).

            <h3>The POC21 Model</h3>
            <p>
                (See the DIY instructions) made with copper pipes and without the automated control system and slightly
                smaller filters for a lower flow rate.
                This is more closely resembles the final product but the placement and look of the filters can be
                modified by the user.

            <h3>The fully operational prototype</h3>
            <p>
                The shower built for 10 l/min and automated piping. Drinking water hose pipe was used for testing and
                fast iterations.

        <h2>The Only Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            The water needs to be collected for the pump which needs to be placed at the lowest point of the shower,
            ideally under the basin. If you have an Italian-style shower you can build a new basin instead of tearing
            the floor apart. We are also working on a way to hack your existing drain and using self-priming pumps so
            that you can plug the drain during loop mode and suck the water out of the small collection basin.
