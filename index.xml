      <description>It’s extremely challenging to lead your daily life while sustaining an injury. And yet, dealing with sports injuries is something that most of us will have to go through, with nearly 2 million sports-related injuries affecting high school athletes alone per year. Most of us know the feeling of attempting to take a shower or bath when your arm is wrapped in a cast and cannot get wet. It’s a defeated feeling, and it can quickly take away the motivation to shower or bathe in the first place.</description>

      <description>Natural water in Finland is some of the most polluted water in Europe (read the discussions in the article). You might be contributing to its pollution without realizing it, such as if you’re putting things down the drain that you really shouldn’t. Making your shower eco-friendly should be about saving water as well as preventing water contamination. Here’s what you can do to be greener and cleaner!
In Finland, people use an average of 140 liters of water every day.</description>

      <description>Low poly showerstall for the Design Museum. Enter &amp; Encounter ExhibitAt the start of the year, we were asked to bring a demo of Showerloop to an art/design/futurism exhibit. We also designed a wooden shower stall to accompany the showerloop system. The shower stall was made with blender, Explision, Meshlab, a lasercutter, circle saw, router, dremel, drill, clamps, hammer, crowbar, screwdriver, nuts, sticks, planks and bits, interior wax and lights.</description>

      <description>For the last couple of months we have gotten back to circuit boards and looking at completing the project we started a long time ago. Making the shower smart and easily controllable like one would expect from modern consumer products. There&#39;s been a lot to learn considering all we could do a few years ago was wire up a light bulb, and even then we would need to check what the difference was with the brown wire (live/positive) and the blue wire (ground/neutral).</description>

      <description>Showerloop Kit Component List 2018ProductionMade in Finland - for the most part. We&#39;ve been doing our best to source materials as locally as possible. Sadly it&#39;s harder and harder to producers here in Finland or if we can it&#39;s just too expensive for us until we can produce more component inhouse.
The main components of the filter and electronics are, however, made here in Finland with the help of tools and expertise from Aalto Fablab in Helsinki, Varia vocational school &amp; AIRO Island Ry.</description>

      <description>Incase you want to support the project we have an effective gofundme campaign.
 Basically we have little raw materials so we recycle a lot of materials, we also have the space and access to tools (yay, Fablab!) that allow us to continue our work.
We are also starting to collaborate with people around the world to bring Showerloop to where they need it, be it a boat, an RV, a house in the woods, a far off Pacific Island, a brand new hay-bale house or a really old building without plumbing.</description>

      <description>Here is the ManualIt’s not ready, but I’m already 227 days overdue. Tragic. I’m really sorry to everyone that I said I’d have it done on the weekend. The inspiration just never came. I didn’t want to dissapoint you, I just dissapointed myself. Anyway. Today is my birthday (16.5.2019) and I turn 33. OMG where is the time going. I think the first Idea for the Showerloop was in the 90’s but I’d say it started in 2012 when we started scavanging parts to start building it.</description>

      <description>Ongoing research:Can we identify a particular type of activated carbon and soap/shampoo combination that is the most effective at removing particulates ***Almost complete***.What is the typical heat loss in a normal shower from shower head to the drain aka how much heating is needed ***Almost complete***.Quality control of source components.Life Cycle Assessment and scoping the needed certifications for products.</description>
